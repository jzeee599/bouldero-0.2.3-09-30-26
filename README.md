# Bouldero

A quiet, mobile-first climbing notebook. **Version 0.2.3F:** safely correct lines, holds, attempts, and past sessions; keep Warm-ups reusable and outside performance-send totals; and use the complete mobile session flow without losing earlier records.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 20.9+ and pnpm.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Without Supabase settings, the app clearly labels local mode and persists projects/photos in IndexedDB in this browser. There are no seeded projects or made-up attempts.

## Connect Supabase

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run all files in `supabase/migrations` in numeric order, or apply them with the Supabase CLI. Existing installations that already applied migration 007 also need migration 008 before editing mapped lines in cloud mode.
3. Enable **Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Anonymous Sign-Ins**.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set the project URL and **publishable** key. Never use a secret/service-role key.
5. Restart the development server. The footer changes to “Private cloud workspace.”

New projects now use private Supabase Storage and Postgres. Local projects are not silently migrated. Anonymous identity persists in this browser; clearing its auth storage loses access to that identity. Account recovery and cross-device sign-in are out of this milestone's scope. For public deployment, configure Supabase's recommended anonymous-auth abuse protection.

## Use

From Home, choose **Start a session**, enter or pick a gym, and use the live session timer at the top of the page. Open one of that gym's ongoing lines, record each attempt, tap the final hold reached, and add an optional note. A Project send completes the line; Warm-up and Training sends keep the line reusable. Lines at other gyms remain editable, but their attempts cannot be mixed into the current gym’s session. End the session when the climbing day is over. Sessions and attempts remain available after reload.

For a mapped attempt, choose whether it began from the ground or from a specific hold. Choose **Couldn’t establish start** when the starting position was never controlled. Otherwise, choose the last hold controlled with stability; merely touching a hold does not count. When several similar attempts accumulated before logging, set **Attempts to add** to save up to 20 in one action. Sends remain single entries.

During an active session, Home shows live counts for attempts, lines created during the session, and ongoing lines carried in from earlier sessions. A line detail page lists the other ongoing lines at the same gym so they can be opened directly. After a send, the completed state is explicit and the next ongoing line is one tap away.

Choose **New line** and upload/take a photo or reuse a saved wall photo. Then choose **Map holds** to place holds from start to finish, or **Reps only** when individual markers are unnecessary. Set its purpose to Project, Warm-up, or Training. Enter the color and grade; the line name is generated automatically. A mapped line can finish on its last hold or by topping out onto the wall. Reused lines reference the original photo rather than storing another copy. Saved hold maps can be reopened, dragged, reordered, deleted, and extended.

Add optional **Line notes** for beta, movement cues, or pain warnings; they remain visible on the line detail page. Before saving, choose a different photo at either setup step if the first selection was wrong. In local mode, use **Export backup** and **Import backup** at the bottom of Home to move or restore all lines, photos, sessions, attempts, and notes. Import uses existing record IDs, so importing the same backup again does not duplicate it.

Open **History** to review sessions newest-first. Each entry shows its gym, duration, lines, attempts, sends, and saved notes. The summary shows total sessions, attempts, sends, and the most recent training date; line details show attempts across sessions and completion date.

Use the line library tabs to switch between **Ongoing**, **Completed**, **Archived**, and **All**. Search by line name, grade, or gym; filter to one gym; and switch between thumbnail and list layouts. From a line detail page, mark it completed, archive it, or move it back to ongoing. During an active session, lines from the current gym sort to the top.

## Verify

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm test
```

Tests exercise the browser upload/save/reload flow, mapping behavior, validation, session/attempt persistence, count-only lines, and true local photo reuse. See [architecture and acceptance risks](docs/architecture.md) and [verification notes](docs/verification.md).

## Deploy

This repository is configured for Vercel with Node.js 22 and an exact, frozen dependency lockfile. Vercel detects the pnpm lockfile and Next.js preset automatically.

The scripts use Next.js's supported Webpack mode. This keeps local development stable when `node_modules` lives outside the iCloud-synced Documents folder; Vercel runs the same production build command.

1. Push this directory to a GitHub repository.
2. In Vercel, select **Add New → Project**, import the repository, and keep the detected Next.js defaults.
3. For device-local testing, leave the Supabase variables unset and deploy. Each phone/browser stores its own projects in IndexedDB.
4. For shared cloud data, apply all migrations in numeric order, enable anonymous sign-ins, then add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in **Project Settings → Environment Variables** for Production, Preview, and Development.
5. Deploy, open the generated HTTPS URL in iPhone Safari, and optionally use **Share → Add to Home Screen**.

No Vercel build-command, output-directory, or install-command override is needed. HTTPS supports the intended phone experience. The manifest provides standalone launch metadata; offline loading/background sync are not implemented.
